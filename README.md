# Lung Cancer Prediction with machine learning model.
### This project focuses on analysing the possibility of lung cancer occurrence. Features which holds a higher correlation to the occurrence of lung cancer will be used to build the predictive model. The model will be used to assess if a person is at high risk for lung cancer.

* Prerequisites:
##### Setup environment using python version 3.11.10 and download dependencies stated in requirements.txt

* Pipeline execution
##### In main.py file edit configure path 'config_path' to run config.yaml file in your designated project folder.
##### In config.yaml file edit 'file_path' to read csv file in your designated project folder.
##### Editing of parameters will be made in 'param_grid' if required.
##### If new features are introduced into the dataset, edit 'file_path' accordingly and insert the new features into the feature lists accordingly.

* Logical Flow
#####
